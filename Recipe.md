Pre heat the oven to 180 degree C(356 degree C).
Take either two 6-inches (round or square) baking pans or one 8-inches baking pan. Greese enitre surface of the pan with oil or melted butter.
sprinkle some AP Flour over it and tilt the pan in all directions so that the flour covers the greased surface. Line the pan with a parchment or butter paper.
Sift 3/2 cups AP flour in a large bowl.
Add a cup of plain curd and 3/4 cup sugar in another large bowl.
Mix well using a wired whsik until smooth. Add 1/2 a teaspoon baking soda and 1 teaspoon baking powder.
Mix well and keep the mixture idle for 5 minutes . As the baking soda starts to react with curd,bubbles will start to appear on the surface.

Add a teaspoon vanilla extract or essence and mix well.
Add previously sifted AP flour.

remove the pan from the oven and insert a toothpick in the center to check whether it s fully cooked or not.
*If it comes out clean,then it means it is cooked.
*If it does not comes out clean,then cook for a few more minutes.
*If the cake turns brown from the top but remais uncooked from inside, cover the pan with alluminum foil to prevent cake from turning brown further. Bake again for 5-10 minutes.
let it cool for 15-20 minutes . Run a knife on sides of the pan. Place a cooling rack ( or a plate) on the pan and invert both the pan and rack(or plate) to remove the cake from pan easily. carefully remove the parchment(or butter) paper. It will come out easily 
Cake is ready. serve with either coffee or garnih with chocolate syrup or vanilla frosting . ENJOY!!!
